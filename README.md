# DOM - Document Object Model
    HTML Tags --become--> Element Objects
    
    DOM is the resulting Elements

    ***document*** is the root element.


Rendering the web page converts the HTML Tags from the original text file into Element objects in memory.
Similar to how classes are converted into instances.

Elements are object instances that can be manipulated with JavaScript.

The attributes and values on the html tags,
become the properties and values on the corresponding Element objects.

The ***DOM*** is a hierarchy of Elements that represents the current state of the web page.
THis mirrors the hierarchy of the tags in the html text file.

***document*** is the name of the root element of the tree of elements.

Everything is a child, or a descendent of the document object.

***window*** is another core object that represents the frame that contains the document.
It knows the size of the window and how far down you have scrolled.
